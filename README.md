<pre>Technician in Industrial Automation and IT Maintenance and
Support at the Federal Institute of São Paulo - Campus Hortolândia.
<br>
I started in programming when I was 16 years old during technicial in
Industrial Automation.
My first experience was with language C and during the course
I started programming in other languages as C#, C++ and Arduino language!
<br>
But, after finishing my course, I decided to migrate to IT area.
And this change began from my first contact with programming and 
also by asking questions and seeing projects from other courses that existed at the Institute.
<br>
For a long period, I studied simultaneously with my work in another area,
but now I want and will dedicate myself fully to my studies and my development as a developer.
